# Notify Cyber Retired Static Website

_October 3, 2025_

## About

[Notify Cyber](https://notifycyber.com/) was a cybersecurity news aggregator launched around June 1, 2023, and operated until October 31, 2025. During that time, it attracted over 17,000 visitors and created numerous opportunities for its creators. The project gained significant traction through this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13xpg3k/my_friend_and_i_made_a_website_to_help_you_stay/).

Since the original site has been shut down, this static version serves as a "retired" snapshot to honor the project's memory. There are no plans to let the domain expire, so this page will remain accessible.

## Why Static?

Notify Cyber was retired due to insufficient monetization to cover maintenance costs. This open-sourced static snapshot is provided for the community to preserve and explore the project.
