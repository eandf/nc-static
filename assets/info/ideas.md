# Random Notes and Findings

## PostgreSQL Docker Compose Setup (4-24-2023)

### Overview

This section captures a brainstorming session on setting up a local PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose for the Notify Cyber project. The goal was to create a simple, reproducible environment with a pre-initialized database and table for storing cyber news data.

### Discussion Summary

I asked for a Docker Compose file to pull the latest PostgreSQL image, run a container on port 5432 with password "password", and auto-create a database named "cybernews" containing a table `public.cybernews`.

Key insights:

- Use the official `postgres:latest` image for simplicity and updates.
- Environment variables handle user, password, and DB creation.
- An init script volume mounts SQL files to run on first startup, ensuring the table exists.
- This setup is great for local development—easy to spin up with `docker-compose up` and tear down.

### Generated Docker Compose File

Save as `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: cybernews
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    restart: always
```

### Initialization Script

Create a folder `init-scripts` next to the YAML file, and add `create-table.sql` inside it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.cybernews (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    published_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

To start: Run `docker-compose up`. The container will initialize the DB and table automatically. Connect via tools like pgAdmin or psql (e.g., `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d cybernews`).

This keeps things lightweight for prototyping Notify Cyber's data storage.

## CVE Database Status Labels (4-7-2023)

### Overview

This notes a conversation exploring Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)—a system for cataloging cybersecurity vulnerabilities. I inquired about specific status labels in the CVE database to understand how entries are tracked and validated, which could inform Notify Cyber's vulnerability alerting features.

### Discussion Summary

First, I listed some labels I'd encountered (RESERVED, REJECT, etc.) and sought explanations. The response clarified their meanings in the context of CVE entry lifecycle. Later, I requested a full list of statuses, revealing a broader set used by the CVE Program.

Key takeaways:

- These labels help manage the quality and accuracy of vulnerability reports.
- They're dynamic; the list can evolve as the MITRE CVE team updates processes.
- For Notify Cyber, understanding these could filter reliable alerts (e.g., ignore REJECT or UNVERIFIABLE entries).

### Label Explanations

From the initial query on specific labels:

- **RESERVED**: CVE ID assigned, but vulnerability details not yet public (embargoed).
- **REJECT**: Proposed entry rejected (e.g., duplicate, invalid, or non-vulnerability).
- **DISPUTED**: Conflicting views on validity or details among reporters/vendors.
- **UNSUPPORTED** (including variants like "UNSUPPPORTED"): Product no longer maintained; no patches available.
- **UNVERIFIABLE**: Report can't be confirmed due to lack of evidence or access.
- **PRODUCT**: Vulnerability tied to a specific product/component (not general).
- **SPLIT**: Original CVE divided into multiple entries for clarity on distinct issues.

### Full List of CVE Status Labels

A comprehensive list provided:

- REJECT
- RESERVED
- DISPUTED
- NON-CVE
- RESERVED (Future use)
- IGNORE
- UNSUPPORTED
- UNVERIFIABLE
- RESERVED (Private use)
- PRODUCT
- SPLIT

Note: This is based on CVE Program standards as of the discussion; check official docs for updates. Useful for parsing CVE feeds in Notify Cyber.

# Random Notes And Findings

## PostgreSQL Docker Compose Setup (4-24-2023)

### About:

A discussion with ChatGPT about creating a Docker Compose file for running a local PostgreSQL database for Notify Cyber.

### Chat Messages:

```
Make me a Docker compose file that will grab the latest Postgresql, then creates a container running PostgreSQL. Have the database with the table public.cybernews created. Have the database run on port 5432 and make the password for the server "password".

Here's a Docker Compose file that will create a container running the latest PostgreSQL, with the specified configuration:
"""
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: cybernews
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    restart: always
"""
Save this content as docker-compose.yml. Additionally, you'll need to create an SQL script to create the public.cybernews table. Create a folder named init-scripts in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file and create a file named create-table.sql inside it with the following content:
"""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.cybernews (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    published_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
"""
Now, run docker-compose up to start the PostgreSQL container with the specified configuration. The SQL script in the init-scripts folder will be executed automatically when the container starts, creating the public.cybernews table if it doesn't exist already.
```

For the CVE database. What do these labels mean:
RESERVED
REJECT
DISPUTED
UNSUPPORTED
UNSUPPPORTED
Unsupported
UNVERIFIABLE
PRODUCT
SPLIT
"""


"""
These labels refer to the status of a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry in the CVE database. Here's what each label means:
    - RESERVED: This status means that a CVE ID has been assigned to a vulnerability, but the details of the vulnerability have not yet been disclosed.
    - REJECT: This status means that a proposed CVE entry has been rejected for some reason, such as a duplicate or invalid report.
    - DISPUTED: This status means that there is disagreement among parties about the validity or details of a CVE entry.
    - UNSUPPORTED/Unsupported: These statuses mean that a vendor or product is no longer supported or maintained, and therefore no updates or patches will be released for any reported vulnerabilities.
    - UNVERIFIABLE: This status means that a vulnerability report cannot be verified by the CVE Program or the report lacks sufficient detail to validate the vulnerability.
    - PRODUCT: This status means that the vulnerability is associated with a specific product or software component, rather than being a general vulnerability that applies to many products.
    - SPLIT: This status means that a previously published CVE entry has been divided into two or more separate entries to better represent the distinct vulnerabilities that were reported.
These labels are used by the CVE Program to provide information about the status and validity of vulnerabilities that have been reported and assigned CVE IDs.
